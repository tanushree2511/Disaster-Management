        <h1>Flood Safety Tips</h1>
        <p>You live in an area prone to flooding. Please read this information to protect you and your loved ones.</p>
        
        <h2>Before the Flood</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay informed – tune into your local news for the latest forecast.</li>
            <li>Determine whether your home, school, or work is in an area likely to flood.</li>
            <li>Learn which roadways are likely to flood and find an alternative route so you can avoid them.</li>
            <li>Create a communications plan so your family will know how to contact you during an emergency.</li>
            <li>Assemble an emergency kit.</li>
            <li>If you live or work in an area prone to flooding, have an emergency bag packed in case you might need to be evacuated. Include medicines and items for your pets.</li>
            <li>Be proactive – leave before the flooding starts to avoid getting stranded.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>During the Flood</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid flood waters at all times. It is NEVER safe to drive or walk through flood waters. Six inches of water can knock you off your feet. Twelve inches of water can carry away a small car.</li>
            <li>Get to higher ground if you are in an area that is subject to flooding.</li>
            <li>Follow evacuation orders and heed warning signs.</li>
            <li>Stay informed – tune into your local news for updates on flooding in progress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>After the Flood</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay informed – tune into your local news for updates on affected areas and the safety of your drinking water.</li>
            <li>Avoid flood waters – standing water can hide chemicals that can make you sick or debris that can cause injury.</li>
            <li>Avoid power lines for risk of electrocution.</li>
            <li>Avoid disaster areas – your presence may hamper emergency operations.</li>
            <li>Heed road closure and cautionary signs.</li>
            <li>Wait for the “All Clear” before returning to an area that was impacted by flooding.</li>
            <li>Contact your family and loved ones to let them know you’re OK.</li>
        </ul>
